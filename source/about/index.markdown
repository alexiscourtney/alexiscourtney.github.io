I am a twenty-six year old girl with a penchant for living in a fantasy world. In March 2013, I embarked on a road-trip move across the country from sunny Florida all the way to rainy Washington. I currently reside in Seattle with my boyfriend Matthew & my betta fish Yvaine.

I have aspirations of talent at writing & behind the lens of a camera. I am a less-often-than-not blogger. I am teaching myself web development. I am an avid reader. I am learning to live all over again.
